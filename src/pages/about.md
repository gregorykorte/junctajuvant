# About

Juncta Juvant was spontaneously conceived by a rogue AI bot trained on [goetta recipes](https://goettalife.com), Joey Votto’s [rookie card](https://marketplace.beckett.com/item/764/2008-topps-opening-day-218-joey-votto-rc_96552358) and the [Smale Commission](https://digital.cincinnatilibrary.org/digital/collection/p16998coll62/id/386/rec/4) report. It is an independent project and not affiliated with any other news organization, employer or Graeter's ice cream flavor.

Adopting Mark Twain’s [totally-not-made-up](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27745901) quote that everything in Cincinnati happens 20 years later, this site uses cutting-edge RSS feed-and-blogroll technology haphazardly curate the latest news from around Cincinnati.

This site gets its name from the civic motto of the City of Cincinnati, [Juncta Juvant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_of_Cincinnati), a Latin phrase that roughly translates to "chili and spaghetti are better when joined together."
